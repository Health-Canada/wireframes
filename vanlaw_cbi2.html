<a id="A"><h2>	1.	Introduction</h2></a>		
<p>Confidential business information (CBI) may be included in a variety of regulatory documents that Health Canada requires companies to provide regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of therapeutic products. In certain situations, where publicly available information is not sufficient, access to information that may contain CBI can assist the work of health researchers and practitioners, contributing to improved patient safety and better health outcomes for Canadians.</p>
<p>This guide describes how Health Canada applies the authority to disclose CBI under paragraph 21.1(3)(c) of the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em>. This provision gives the Minister of Health discretionary authority to disclose CBI to eligible persons for the purpose of protecting or promoting human health or the safety of the public.</p>
<p>This guide does not apply to other authorities in the Food and Drugs Act, which permit Health Canada to disclose CBI when the Minister believes that a product may present a serious risk of injury to human health, to other governments, and persons from whom the Minister seeks advice. Information on these authorities can be found in, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/legislation/unsafedrugs-droguesdangereuses-amendments-modifications-eng.php">Amendments to the Food and Drugs Act 2014 -- Guide to New Authorities</a>.</p>

   
	<h3>About this guide</h3>

<p>Guidance documents are meant to assist individuals and organizations to comply with Health Canada's policies and its governing statutes and regulations. They also serve to assist Health Canada staff to implement its mandates in a fair, consistent and effective manner.
</p><p>
Guidance documents are administrative instruments not having force of law and, as such, allow for flexibility in approach. Alternate approaches to the principles, considerations and requirements described in this document may be acceptable provided they comply with relevant laws. Discussion with the relevant program area in advance is encouraged to determine whether an alternative approach meets applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.
</p><p>
As a corollary to the above, it is equally important to note that Health Canada reserves the right to request information or material, or define conditions not specifically described in this guidance document, in order to allow the Department to adequately assess whether or not to disclose CBI related to a therapeutic product. Health Canada is committed to ensuring that such requests are justifiable and that decisions are clearly documented.
</p>

   
	<a  id="B"><h2>2.	Paragraph 21.1(3)(c) of the Food and Drugs Act</h2></a>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
21.1(3) The Minister may disclose confidential business information about a therapeutic product without notifying the person to whose business or affairs the information relates or obtaining their consent, if the purpose of the disclosure is related to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public and the disclosure is to
<br />(a) a government;
<br />(b) a person from whom the Minister seeks advice; or
<br />(c) a person who carries out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Under paragraph 21.1(3)(c), the Minister of Health has discretionary authority to disclose CBI to an individual or corporation who carries out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public for the purpose of protecting or promoting human health or the safety of the public. This discretionary authority was added to the Food and Drugs Act by the Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act (Vanessa's Law) and came into force in November 2014.</p>
<p>The disclosure authority in paragraph 21.1(3)(c) complements other changes introduced to strengthen Health Canada's capacity to respond quickly to health risks and to promote greater confidence in the oversight of therapeutic products by increasing transparency.  These changes are summarized in a separate guidance document, Amendments to the Food and Drugs Act: Guide to New Authorities (http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/legislation/unsafedrugs-droguesdangereuses-amendments-modifications-eng.php.)
</p><p>
Vanessa's Law also added a definition of CBI to the Food and Drugs Act. This definition codifies common law principles and is consistent with other domestic law. It sets out three conditions that must be met in order for information to be considered CBI.
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
"'confidential business information",  in respect of a person to whose business or affairs the information relates, means - subject to the regulations - business information:
<br />(a) that is not publicly available,
<br />(b) in respect of which the person has taken measures that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that it remains not publicly available, and
<br />(c) that has actual or potential economic value to the person or their competitors because it is not publicly available and its disclosure would result in a material financial loss to the person or a material financial gain to their competitors.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The Food and Drugs Act defines "therapeutic product” to mean "a drug or device or
any combination of drugs and devices, but does not include a natural health product within the meaning of the Natural Health Products Regulations.”
</p><p>
The authority to disclose CBI under paragraph 21.1(3)(c) therefore applies to CBI related to therapeutic products, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, vaccines, blood and blood products, radiopharmaceuticals, donor semen for assisted conception, gene and cell therapies, tissues and organs, and medical devices. It does not apply to CBI related to natural health products.
</p><p>
Vanessa's Law also provides regulation making powers to specify what information obtained under the Food and Drugs Act in relation to a therapeutic product authorization is not or ceases to be CBI, and to authorize disclosure of this information. Supporting regulations may be developed at a later date with input from internal and external stakeholders.
</p>

	<a id="C"><h2>3. Principles and Considerations for Health Canada's Exercise of the Authority under Paragraph 21.1(3)(c) of the Food and Drugs Act </h2></a>

	<p>Health Canada's application of this authority is guided by principles of administrative law, which require that powers be exercised fairly, reasonably and in accordance with the powers duly conferred on the body exercising them.  
</p><p>
The following principles and considerations, consistent with the broad administrative law principles noted above, provide additional guidance on the exercise of the discretion under paragraph 21.1(3)(c).
</p>
<h3>3.1 Principles</h3>
<ol type="i">
<li>Health Canada will be judicious in its exercise of this authority. The requirements of paragraph 21.1(3)(c) are broadly defined to permit the Minister to act in a variety of circumstances. In addition to considering whether or not the requirements of the Act would be fulfilled, a decision on whether to disclose CBI under this authority should consider all relevant factors both for and against exercising the discretion to disclose in the particular circumstances.
</li><li>Consistent with the objectives of the Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act, information disclosed under this authority should relate to therapeutic products marketed in Canada and contribute to improving the health of Canadians. Requests for disclosure under this authority should clearly define how the purpose relates to the above objective and include a formal plan to use the information to advance knowledge, including making results publicly available.
</li><li>Use of this authority should be necessary to achieve the purpose for which the information is requested. A decision on whether or not to disclose CBI will include consideration of whether or not all other possible sources of the information, including from the originator of the information, have been exhausted. Only information that is directly related to the purpose set out in the request should be considered for disclosure.
</li><li>Information disclosed under this authority should be kept confidential and used only for non-commercial purposes. Prior to disclosure, Health Canada requires that potential recipients of CBI sign a legally binding agreement to maintain confidentiality and confirm that the information will not be used for commercial purposes. Further, potential recipients must report any activities that could result in a conflict of interest. These requirements are important factors in Health Canada's decisions regarding disclosure of CBI under this authority. 
</li><li>Health Canada will maintain the integrity of its regulatory function. It will consider the consequences of disclosure on its capacity to evaluate and regulate therapeutic products based on science and the interests of the health of Canadians. Consequently, consideration will be given to the current stage of the regulatory decision.
</li></ol>
<h3>3.2. Considerations - Persons to whom CBI may be disclose</h3>
	<p>Health Canada's decision regarding disclosure of CBI includes an assessment of whether the person to whom the CBI would be disclosed fulfills the Act's requirement that they be a person who carries out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.
</p><p>
Where disclosure of CBI has been requested by an individual, Health Canada expects that the principal requester would have qualifications in a health profession and demonstrated expertise in the subject of the request.
</p><p>
Where disclosure of CBI has been requested by a corporation, Health Canada expects that its corporate mandate, as described in its articles of incorporation or other documentation, would include purposes relevant to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public and the health or safety issue that is the subject of the request. In addition, it is expected that the designated representative of the corporation identified in the request would have qualifications in a health profession and demonstrated expertise in the topic of the research.
</p><p>
An assessment of the qualifications of a requester may include other considerations, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Health Canada's decision regarding disclosure of CBI includes an assessment of whether the person to whom the CBI would be disclosed fulfills the Act's requirement that they be a person who carries out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.

</li><li>Where disclosure of CBI has been requested by an individual, Health Canada expects that the principal requester would have qualifications in a health profession and demonstrated expertise in the subject of the request.

</li><li>Where disclosure of CBI has been requested by a corporation, Health Canada expects that its corporate mandate, as described in its articles of incorporation or other documentation, would include purposes relevant to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public and the health or safety issue that is the subject of the request. In addition, it is expected that the designated representative of the corporation identified in the request would have qualifications in a health profession and demonstrated expertise in the topic of the research.

</li><li>An assessment of the qualifications of a requester may include other considerations, including:
</li></ul>
<h3>3.3 Considerations - Purpose of disclosure</h3>
	<p>Health Canada's decision regarding disclosure of CBI will also include an assessment of whether the disclosure would fulfill the Act's requirement that the "purpose of the disclosure is related to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.” 
</p><p>
To fulfill this requirement, a request would normally need to relate to a therapeutic product that is authorized for marketing in Canada. Public exposure to a therapeutic product is generally required in order for CBI related to the product to be used for protecting or promoting human health or the safety of the public. Consequently, Health Canada expects that requests for disclosure will relate to CBI obtained in the course of its regulatory activities to evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of therapeutic products that are authorized for marketing in Canada.
</p><p>
Health Canada may also consider the following to assess the purpose of disclosure.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrated relevance of the proposed project to the purpose of protecting or promoting human health or the safety of the public.  Evidence should be provided regarding the health and safety issue to which the request relates, and requests should explain how use of the disclosed information would advance efforts in this area.
</li><li>The severity of the health or safety issue to which the request relates, or the vulnerability of the affected population.
</li><li>The feasibility of the proposed use of the CBI.  A project summary should outline how its objectives will be accomplished with the available expertise and resources.
</li><li>The anticipated impact of the proposed use of the CBI on the health and safety of Canadians.
</li><li>The type of information requested. Health Canada expects that requests for disclosure will relate to CBI obtained in the course of its regulatory activities to evaluate and monitor therapeutic products that are authorized for sale in Canada. Such information may include:
<li>CBI that relates to a therapeutic product that has been authorized for sale in Canada but has not yet been introduced to the Canadian market. Once a therapeutic product has been authorized for sale by Health Canada, the market authorization holder can place the product on the market or remove it from the market without further regulatory requirements. 
</li><li>CBI related to an amendment of a market authorization to obtain approval for new uses or indications for a product already authorized for sale, or authorization for changes that may affect the safety, efficacy or quality of an authorized product. CBI in such submissions or applications may add to the body of knowledge regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of a product to which Canadians are exposed. Consideration should be given to the consequences of disclosure for the integrity of Health Canada's regulatory function, particularly for information related to amendments to market authorization (for example, supplemental submissions) that are in review, cancelled, withdrawn, or rejected.
</li><li>Interim clinical study results related to a therapeutic product authorized for sale in Canada -- provided the disclosure does not jeopardize the completion of the study or the integrity of Health Canada's regulatory function. The privacy of all study participants will be protected as described in section 4. Consideration of requests related to interim study results may involve an assessment on whether the benefits of a disclosure outweigh any risks associated with the creation of study bias that may jeopardize the completion of an ongoing study.
</li><li>Other information obtained by Health Canada for post-market surveillance purposes, e.g., information obtained from the company indicating a potential but not established new risk where there is some expectation of confidentiality, information obtained pursuant to a risk management plan (RMP) through a periodic safety update report (PSUR), information that was provided by a market authorization holder used to conduct a signal assessment or other safety review or to issue a risk communication.
</li><li>Disclosure of information will need to respect the informed consent forms from the study participants provided in the clinical trial data for potential future or secondary research --  if that information is available.   
</li><li>Other information obtained by Health Canada for compliance and enforcement purposes, e.g., information obtained for an inspection report. 
</li><li>[requires consultation with Inspectorate]</li></li>
</ul>	
	
<a id="D"><h2>4.	Protection of Personal Information</h2></a>
<p>[to be completed in consultation with Privacy Management Division, CSB]</p><p>

<a id="E"><h2>5.	Protection against Commercial Use</h2></a>
<p>Health Canada will exercise this authority taking into account the importance of protecting CBI against commercial use. Requesters are required to confirm that the project for which they request disclosure of CBI is for a non-commercial purpose. Health Canada also requires requesters to complete a Conflict of Interest declaration. Health Canada reviews the information provided in the declaration to determine whether or not to disclose CBI to a requester whose financial interests, employment and other affiliations could conflict with their commitment to use the CBI exclusively for non-commercial purposes that supports the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.</p>
<a id="F"><h2>6.	Maintaining Confidentiality of Disclosed Information</h2></a>
<p>Health Canada requires requesters to sign a legally binding Confidentiality Agreement to maintain the confidentiality of disclosed information. Among other things, this Agreement provides that the disclosed information can be used only for the purposes of the project and must be kept confidential using appropriate safeguards. The Confidentiality Agreement also prohibits reproduction of disclosed information. The requester is free to publish results of the analysis as long as the confidentiality of the disclosed information is maintained.</p>
<a id="G"><h2>7.	Process to Review Requests for Disclosure </h2></a>
<p>Health Canada's decision is based on a rigorous evaluation and a review process that is fair, reasonable and takes into account all relevant factors. The review process is overseen by a committee of senior Health Canada officials mandated to recommend a decision based on relevant technical and scientific expertise. The Review Committee recommendation is considered by a senior Health Canada official, not involved in the review process, who has been designated to exercise the Minister's authority to disclose CBI under the Food and Drugs Act (section 21.1(3)(c)).</p>
<p>Key steps in the process are outlined below. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Requests are reviewed to ensure that they are complete, including proof of qualifications, corporate mandate, and a project description that includes a specific purpose for seeking access to CBI. Incomplete requests will be returned to the requester. 
</li><li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Complete requests are referred to a Review Committee for assessment. The Committee will assess whether or not the request meets the requirements of the Act, taking into account the requester's qualifications, corporate mandate (where relevant) and the proposed project. Where a request does not meet the requirements of the Act, the Committee will recommend that it be denied. Where a request meets the requirements of the Act, the Committee will proceed to the next step in the review process. 
</li><li><strong>Record search</strong>: For requests that meet the requirements of the Act, Health Canada will conduct a search of its records. The search will identify records that include information described in the request and that are directly related to the project described in the request. If the records contain no CBI, the requester will be notified and provided an opportunity to obtain the information from the appropriate Health Canada office or Access to Information division.
</li><li><strong>Communication with requester</strong>: If CBI is included in records relating to an assessed request, the requester will be notified and, where large volumes of records have been identified, may be consulted to refine their request. At this stage the requester will be asked to complete a Conflict of Interest Declaration and to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. The signing of a Confidentiality Agreement by the requester at this point in the process does not mean that information will be disclosed. Further information may also be required in order to complete Health Canada's review of the request.
</li><li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Once the requester has provided a completed Conflict of Interest Declaration, signed Confidentiality Agreement and any other required information, the Review Committee will prepare a recommendation regarding whether to disclose records containing CBI identified in the record search.  The recommendation will include the assessment that a request meets the requirements of the Act and an assessment of whether or not the Minister should exercise her authority to disclose CBI, based on the principles and considerations in section 3 of this guide and other factors relevant to the particular request. Some records relevant to a particular request may contain information obtained with a commitment regarding their use and disclosure (e.g., information from another regulatory authority or information considered solicitor-client privilege). Health Canada will continue to abide by its commitments regarding the use and disclosure of information obtained through these arrangements.
</li><li><strong>Decision</strong>: The Review Committee recommendation is considered by a senior Health Canada official designated to exercise the Minister's authority to disclose CBI under the Food and Drugs Act (section 21.1(3)(c)). When the decision is to disclose CBI, Health Canada will give effect to the Confidentiality Agreement.
</li><li><strong>Notification to requester</strong>: Health Canada will notify the requester of its decision. When the decision is to disclose CBI, arrangements will be made to ensure secure transmission of the information to the recipient.  When the decision is to refuse to disclose CBI, the requester will be notified with an explanation for the decision.
</li><li><strong>Notification to originator</strong>: Health Canada does not notify the originator of the CBI when it is considering a request for disclosure.  As a voluntary practice, Health Canada may notify the originator following disclosure of CBI.</li>
</li><li><strong>Notification of the public</strong>: Information regarding the request, including a description of the project and the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, may be made public.

</ol>

<a id="H"><h2>8.	Requirements for persons requesting disclosure of CBI under paragraph 21.1(3)(c)</h2></a>
<p>Health Canada expects that decisions regarding disclosure of CBI under paragraph 21.1(3)(c) will normally be in response to a request from an individual or corporation. For this purpose, Health Canada provides a request form that should be completed by requesters. All requests should include the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li>Personal and contact information for the principal requester.
</li><li>Professional information for the principal requester, including professional qualifications, employment and relevant research experience.
</li><li>Names and positions of project collaborators.
</li><li>A description of the information requested, including the therapeutic product and regulatory functions to which the information relates. Requesters are encouraged to consult Health Canada's on-line databases of regulatory information and other resources in order to specify their requests as much as possible.
</li><li>Indication that the requester has exhausted other sources of the information requested, including from the originator of the information.
</li><li>A project summary that clearly indicates the purpose of the proposed disclosure and how it relates to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public.
</li><li>Confirmation that the requested information will not be used for commercial purposes.</li>

<p>If a request is incomplete, a requester may be asked to provide missing information.
</p><p>
Where Health Canada's assessment finds that the request meets the requirements of the Act, a requester will be asked to provide additional information required to prepare a recommendation regarding disclosure. This will include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A completed Conflict of Interest Declaration that provides information required by Health Canada to assess whether or not the requester's financial interests and other affiliations may conflict with their use of the requested information. 
</li><li>A signed Confidentiality Agreement with Health Canada that would take effect only if and when Health Canada decides to disclose CBI to the requester.
</li><li>The requester's consent for Health Canada to provide, if it decides to disclose CBI, the project summary and the Confidentiality Agreement to the originator following disclosure of the CBI and to make this information public.
</li><li>A dissemination plan to make the results of the project publicly available.</li>
</ul></ul>

<a id="I"><h2>9.	Findings generated from disclosed information</h2></a>
<p>Recipients of disclosed information are expected to make the findings of their undertakings with the disclosed information publicly available when the findings provide additional knowledge about the therapeutic product under study. If the recipient of disclosed information has made a determination that the safety, efficacy or quality of a product(s) is changed as a result of the evaluation of the CBI then the results should be submitted to Health Canada. Health Canada considers and assesses on a regulatory basis a multitude of sources when deciding the priority of a potential signal. This includes literature, decisions made in a foreign jurisdiction as well as information provided by a recipient of CBI, which could lead to the prioritization of a signal for a safety review. 
</p><p>
As always, Health Canada will take the necessary actions to safeguard the health and safety of Canadians should the benefit, harm and uncertainty profile of a product(s) be determined changed. Manuscripts should be copied to Health Canada 15 days prior to submission as a courtesy and in order for Health Canada to verify that the disclosed information was used for the purpose of the project. Additionally, Health Canada may have a safety review underway or completed that could impact the research paper or article that the recipient of CBI may wish to consider.
