<h2>DIANE 35 (Cyproterone Acetate and Ethinyl Estradiol) - Venous Thromboembolism (blood clot)</h2>
<p>April 8, 2014</p>
<details class="span-8"><summary><strong>Issue</strong></summary>
				<p>As part of Health Canada's efforts to minimize health risk factors to Canadians, a safety review was initiated to evaluate the currently available information regarding the potential risk of blood clots with DIANE-35. The review was prompted by a French medicines regulatory agency announcement on January 30th, 2013 indicating its intention to suspend the marketing authorizations for DIANE-35 and its generics for acne treatment in France within 3 months. The French decision was triggered by reports of deaths caused by blood clots associated with the use of DIANE-35 in France.<sup><a id="fnb1-ref" class="footnote-link" href="#fnb1"><span class="cn-invisible">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> The Health Canada review includes the consideration of strategies that would minimize potential risks to Canadians with the use of DIANE-35.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="span-8"><summary><strong>Background</strong></summary>
				<h3>Approved use of DIANE-35 and its generics in Canada</h3>
				<p>DIANE-35 and its generics are approved in Canada for the treatment of severe acne with accompanying symptoms of androgenisation (male characteristics) including excessively oily skin as well as facial and body hair growth, after topical therapy or systemic antibiotic treatments have failed. It is to be used only after other acne treatments have not worked. In discussion with a woman's health care provider, the use of these medicines should be discontinued when signs of acne have cleared.</p>
				<h3>Blood clot-related side effects</h3>
				<p>Blood clots are a rare but well-known side effect associated with the use of DIANE-35 and other hormonal products containing progestins and estrogens. The risk of blood clot formation is less common in young, healthy, non-pregnant women than in those on hormonal products. Other issues that may increase a woman's chance of developing a clot include older age, smoking, obesity and periods of immobility such as those associated with long-distance travel or hospitalization. Some evidence indicates that the chance of developing clots may be higher during the first year of use with hormonal products. The risk of blood clots is outlined in the product information available to the public.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="span-8"><summary><strong>Objective</strong></summary>
				<p>To assess the available evidence that dealt with a woman's chance of developing a blood clot while taking DIANE-35. The evidence considered Canadian patient reports, scientific and medical literature, and what is known about the use of this medicine both in Canada and internationally. The currently existing strategies to minimize this risk were also considered, including a review of the product information available to health care professionals and patients.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="span-8"><summary><strong>Key Findings</strong></summary>
				<h3>Use of DIANE-35 in Canada</h3>
				<p>Health Canada estimates the number of prescriptions for DIANE-35 and generics to be stable over the last five years at approximately 450,000 prescriptions per year, which corresponds to about	40,000 women using this drug each year in Canada. The major reason for prescribing this medicine is for the treatment of severe acne, but the data also indicates its usage as a means of birth control (estimated at 35-40% of prescriptions given by general practitioners and obstetrician/gynecologists), which is considered an unapproved use of this drug. However, due to the relatively low number of overall prescriptions for DIANE-35 in Canada, these figures on use as a means of birth control can only be used as guidance for estimation.</p>
				<h3>Canadian reports of blood clots associated with DIANE-35 use</h3>
				<p>The Canada Vigilance database was searched for reports that implicated both cyproterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol products and a blood clot-related incident or any report of death. Reports from the point of DIANE-35 becoming available in Canada, in 1998, up to May 1, 2013, were collected. The search retrieved 95 unique reports. A total of 12 reports of death were identified and were further investigated. In 10 out of the 12 cases, the likelihood of the drug causing the death was considered to be at least &quot;possible,&quot; with the other two reports containing not enough information to determine whether or not the drug caused the death. However, in nine out of these possible 10 cases, the patients had additional risk factors that would predispose or make it possible for them to have blood clots, such as obesity, smoking, previous trauma and decreased mobility. The case reports do not indicate a change in the known safety profile of DIANE-35 for blood clots in Canada.</p>
				<h3>Scientific Reports</h3>
				<p>The review considered the scientific and medical literature. Several scientific studies addressed the risk of blood clots with different types of hormonal products such as DIANE-35 and birth control pills. The risk of blood clots with these products was compared to the risk of blood clots in women that do not use these products. It was found that the occurrence of blood clots in users of DIANE-35 was higher than non-users but similar to some of the hormonal birth control products currently available on the Canadian market. It was concluded that this information does not point to a higher risk of blood clots than what is already known about DIANE-35 and outlined in the product information.</p>
				<h3>Usage of DIANE-35 in France and internationally</h3>
				<p>It was important to determine how DIANE-35 was being used in other countries to better understand the French medicines regulatory agency's decision. At that time, the approved use of the drug in France was for treating acne, potentially exposing a greater number of French patients to the risk of blood clots than in Canada. In comparison, the approved use in the United Kingdom is similar to Canada: for treatment of moderate to severe acne and after used topical therapy or systemic antibiotic treatments have failed.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="span-8"><summary><strong>Conclusions and Actions</strong></summary>
				<p>The current prescribing information for DIANE-35 already contained warnings about the risk of blood clots. This information is supported by evidence from key scientific studies. Considering the current evidence and discussions that have taken place internationally, Health Canada is adopting a precautionary approach and has updated the prescribing information to provide further clarity regarding this rare but known risk. The completion of the review was communicated in the form of an advisory, to inform the public and health care professionals about the safe use of this product in the appropriate patient population. Health Canada's review of the safety of the anti-acne medication DIANE-35 has found that the drug's benefits continue to outweigh the risks, when used as authorized.</p>
