        <summary class="background-accent">What The Medication Is Used For</summary>
        
                <p>ABILIFY is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents (15-17 years of age). Schizophrenia is characterised by symptoms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>hearing, seeing or sensing things that are not there,</li>
                  <li>suspiciousness, mistaken beliefs,</li>
                  <li>incoherent speech and behaviour and emotional flatness.</li>
               </ul>
                <p>People with this condition may also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense.</p>
                <p>ABILIFY is also used to treat adults and adolescent patients (13-17 years of age) who suffer from manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder. Bipolar disorder is a condition with symptoms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>feeling invincible or an all powerful inflated self-esteem</li>
                  <li>racing thoughts, easily losing train of thought</li>
                  <li>overreaction to what is seen or heard</li>
                  <li>misinterpretation of events</li>
                  <li>sped-up activity, talking very quickly, too loudly, or more than usual,</li>
                  <li>decreased need for sleep</li>
                  <li>poor judgment</li>
                  <li>sometimes exhibiting severe irritability</li>
               </ul>
                <p>ABILIFY is also used to treat symptoms of depression in adults when administered with your current antidepressant medicine. It is prescribed when you do not respond adequately to an antidepressant alone and after you have tried different antidepressant treatments during your current depressive episode.</p>
                <p>Depression is a condition with symptoms such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>feeling sad,</li>
                  <li>a change in appetite or weight,</li>
                  <li>difficulty concentrating or sleeping,</li>
                  <li>feeling tired,</li>
                  <li>headaches,</li>
                  <li>unexplained aches and pain.</li>
               </ul>
                <p>It is important to discuss your depressive symptoms and possible side effects of ABILIFY with your doctor.</p>
                <p>ABILIFY is not a cure for your condition, but it can help manage your symptoms and in adult patients may reduce the risk of relapse.</p>
                <p>Your doctor may have prescribed ABILIFY for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why ABILIFY has been prescribed for you.</p>

        <summary class="background-accent">What It Does</summary>
        
                <p>
                  <strong>ABILIFY belongs to a group of medicines called atypical antipsychotic drugs.</strong>
               </p>
                <p>Antipsychotic medications affect the chemicals that allow communication between nerve cells (neurotransmitters). Illnesses that affect the brain may be due to certain chemicals in the brain being out of balance. These imbalances may cause some of the symptoms you may be experiencing. Doctors and scientists are not sure what causes these imbalances to occur. Exactly how ABILIFY works is unknown. However, it seems to adjust the balance of chemicals called dopamine and serotonin.</p>

              <ul>
                  <li>If you are taking other medicines, your doctor may need to change your dose of ABILIFY. You should tell your doctor if you are taking ketoconazole (antifungal), quinidine (antiarrythmic), paroxetine (antidepressant) or fluoxetine (antidepressant). These medicines may lead to higher concentrations of aripiprazole in your blood.</li>
                  <li>You should also tell your doctor if you are taking carbamazepine as it may lead to lower concentrations of aripiprazole in your blood, making ABILIFY less effective.</li>
               </ul>
              <p>ABILIFY may increase the effect of medicines used to lower the blood pressure. Be sure to tell your doctor if you take a medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.</p>

          <summary class="background-accent">Proper Use Of This Medication</summary>
        
              <p>The most important thing about taking ABILIFY is to take it exactly the way your doctor has prescribed it, every day.  You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor has decided on the best dosage for you based on your individual situation. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on your response.</p>
              <h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
              <p>
                  <strong>Usual adult dose: The usual dose is 10 mg or 15 mg once a day, without regard to meals.</strong> However your doctor may prescribe a lower or higher dose to a maximum of 30 mg once a day.</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Usual adolescent (15 -17 years of age) dose:</strong> The usual dose is 10 mg once a day, without regard to meals. At the start of treatment, your doctor will prescribe a lower daily dose (2 mg) and will increase the dose to 5 mg once a day after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg once a day after 2 additional days. Depending on how well you respond and tolerate the 10 mg dose, your doctor may prescribe a lower or higher dose, to a maximum of 30 mg once a day.</p>
              <h3>Manic or Mixed Episodes in Bipolar I Disorder</h3>
              <p>
                  <strong>Usual adult dose:</strong> The usual dose is 15 mg once a day, without regard to meals. However your doctor may increase the dose to 30 mg once a day.</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Usual adolescent (13 -17 years of age) dose:</strong> The usual dose is 10 mg once a day, without regard to meals. At the start of treatment, your doctor may prescribe a lower daily dose (2 mg once a day) and may increase the dose to 5 mg once a day after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg once a day after at least 2 additional days. Depending on how well you respond and tolerate the 10 mg dose, your doctor may prescribe a lower or higher dose, to a maximum of 30 mg once a day.</p>
              <p>The maximum dose should not exceed 30 mg once a day</p>
              <h3>Depression</h3>
              <p>
                  <strong>Usual adult dose:</strong> The usual starting dose is 2 -5 mg once a day administered with the antidepressant you are already taking. Depending on how well you respond and tolerate the initial dose, your doctor may prescribe a lower or higher dose, to a maximum of 15 mg once a day.</p>
              <p>Try to take ABILIFY at the same time each day. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food. Always take the tablet with water and swallow it whole.</p>
              <p>If you have the impression that the effect of ABILIFY is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
              <p>Even if you feel better, do not change or discontinue the daily dose of ABILIFY without first consulting your doctor. Although ABILIFY cannot cure your condition, it can help relieve your symptoms. If your symptoms improve or disappear, it is probably because your treatment is working. ABILIFY should be taken for as long as you and your doctor believe it is helping you.</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Do not</strong> give ABILIFY to anyone else. Your doctor has prescribed it for you and your condition.</p>
              <p>ABILIFY is not for use in children under 13 years of age for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder, or for use in children under the age of 15 years for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p>
              <h3>Overdose</h3>
              <div class="well">If you have taken more ABILIFY tablets than your doctor has prescribed (or if someone else has taken some of your ABILIFY tablets), contact your regional Poison Control Centre and talk to your doctor right away or go to your nearest hospital emergency department. Take the medication package with you.</div>
              <h3>Missed Dose</h3>
              <p>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember but <strong>do not take two doses in one day.</strong>

          <summary class="background-accent">Side Effects And What To Do About Them</summary>
        
              <p>Like other medicines, ABILIFY can cause some side effects. These side effects are most likely to be minor and temporary. However, some may be serious and need medical attention.</p>
              <p>Certain side effects occur more frequently in adolescent compared to adult patients, including abnormal movements, drowsiness and weight gain.</p>
              <p>The most common side effects of ABILIFY are:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>feeling of restlessness (akathisia)</li>
                  <li>drowsiness</li>
                  <li>shaking (tremors)</li>
                  <li>abnormal movements</li>
                  <li>nausea, vomiting, upset stomach</li>
                  <li>dizziness</li>
                  <li>constipation</li>
                  <li>headaches</li>
                  <li>insomnia</li>
                  <li>anxiety</li>
               </ul>
              <p>The following other side effects may also happen in some people who take ABILIFY:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>weight gain</li>
                  <li>increase in the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of high blood sugar can include feeling very thirsty and/or hungry, needing to urinate more than usual, feeling weak or tired, feeling sick to your stomach, feeling confused, fruity smelling breath.</li>
                  <li>decrease in the amount of white blood cells.</li>
                  <li>difficulty swallowing, which may lead to aspiration and choking.</li>
                  <li>decreased blood pressure. Symptoms of decreased blood pressure can include lightheadedness or fainting when rising too quickly from a sitting or lying position.</li>
               </ul>
              <p>Because some people experience sleepiness, you should avoid driving a car or operating machinery until you know how ABILIFY affects you.</p>
              <p>Your doctor should check your body weight before starting ABILIFY and continue to monitor it for as long as you are being treated.</p>
              <p>Your doctor should take blood tests before starting ABILIFY. These tests will monitor blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides and the number of infection fighting white blood cells. Your doctor should continue to monitor your blood for as long as you are being treated.</p>
              <p>You should tell your doctor if you notice any symptoms that worry you, even if you think the problems are not connected with the medicine or are not listed here.</p>

          <h4>Adults</h4>
          <h5>Schizophrenia</h5>
          <p>ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders in adults. In controlled clinical trials, ABILIFY was found to improve both positive and negative symptoms.</p><p>
    ABILIFY has been shown to be more effective than placebo in maintaining clinical improvement for up to 26 weeks in adults.</p>  
          <h5>Bipolar Disorder</h5>
          <p>ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is indicated for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder in adults. ABILIFY may be used as acute monotherapy or cotherapy with lithium or divalproex sodium when there is an insufficient acute response to these agents alone.</p><p>
    ABILIFY as cotherapy with lithium or divalproex sodium has been shown to be more effective than placebo plus mood stabilizer in maintaining clinical improvement for up to 1 year in adult patients with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (see CLINICAL TRIALS).</p>  
    <p>The physician who elects to use ABILIFY for extended periods should periodically re evaluate the long term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.</p>

        <summary class="background-accent">Contraindications</summary>  
          <p>ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is contraindicated in those patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug or the excipients of the product. For a complete listing, see DOSAGE FORMS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING.</p>
          <h4>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h4>
          <p>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia
    Elderly patients with dementia treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Analyses of thirteen placebo-controlled trials with various atypical antipsychotics (modal duration of 10 weeks) in these patients showed a mean 1.6-fold increase in the death rate in the drug-treated patients. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Special Populations, Use in Elderly Patients with Dementia).</p>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <p>Body Temperature Regulation
    Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ABILIFY for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (eg, exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</p>
          <h4>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis</h4>

    <summary class="background-accent">Adverse Reactions</summary>  
      <h4>Adverse Drug Reaction Overview</h4>
      <p>Aripiprazole was evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, dementia of the Alzheimers type, Parkinson’s disease, and alcoholism, and who had approximately 7619 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole and 749 patients with exposure to aripiprazole injection. A total of 3390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure.</p>
      <p>The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole (monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.
Aripiprazole was evaluated for safety in 202 adolescent patients (13 - 17 years of age) with schizophrenia in a 6 week placebo controlled clinical trial. Adolescent patients from this study were also treated with oral aripiprazole in uncontrolled, open label studies for more than 26 weeks (n=178) and more than 52 weeks (n=79). Treatment emergent adverse event frequencies are reported for adolescent patients, 13 - 17 years of age, with schizophrenia that were included in these studies, but the majority of patients were 15 - 17 years of age.</p><p>
Aripiprazole was evaluated for safety in 233 pediatric and adolescent patients (10 -17 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in bipolar I disorder. A total of 103 pediatric and adolescent patients with bipolar I disorder were treated with oral aripiprazole for more than 26 weeks. Treatment emergent adverse frequencies are reported for pediatric and adolescent patients, 10 - 17 years of age in a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, but the majority of patients were 13 - 17 years of age
ABILIFY is not indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent patients under 15 years or for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in patients under 13 years of age due to insufficient safety and efficacy data (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, CLINICAL TRIALS, Schizophrenia, Adolescents and Bipolar Disorder, Pediatric and Adolescent Patients).</p><p>
Adverse events during exposure were obtained by collecting volunteered adverse events, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECG. Adverse events were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. In the tables and tabulations that follow, MedDRA dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events into a smaller number of standardized event categories, in order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals reporting adverse events.</p><p>
The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who reported at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. There was no attempt to use investigator causality assessments; i.e. all events meeting the defined criteria, regardless of investigator causality are included.</p>
