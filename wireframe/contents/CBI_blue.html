<p>Under the Food and Drugs Act, Health Canada can disclose confidential business information to certain individuals or organizations for the purpose of protecting or promoting human health or public safety. This authority was added to the Food and Drugs Act by the Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act (Vanessa’s Law) and came into force in November 2014. It complements other changes introduced to strengthen Health Canada’s capacity to respond quickly to health risks and to increase transparency of regulatory health and safety information.</p><p>

Confidential business information (CBI) may be included in studies and data that Health Canada requires drug manufacturers and other companies to provide regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of their products. In certain situations, access to this CBI can assist the work of health researchers and clinicians, contributing to improved patient safety and better health outcomes for Canadians. </p><p>

Consistent with legal protections for CBI, access to this information is disclosed only to qualified individuals or organizations for a specific purpose relating to human health or public safety and with appropriate safeguards to maintain confidentiality of the disclosed information. </p><p>

Other procedures are in place for Health Canada to disclose CBI when there is a risk of serious injury to health, and for Health Canada to disclose CBI to other government agencies, regulatory counterparts and members of advisory bodies.</p>

<a id="A1"><h3>Who qualifies for access to confidential business information?</h3></a>

<p>An individual or organization requesting access to information that contains CBI must demonstrate that they carry out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public. Health Canada will consider requests only from individuals with relevant professional qualifications and responsibilities, and from organizations with a publicly recognized mandate relating to human health or public safety.  </p>

<a id="B1"><h3>What information can be disclosed?</h3></a>

<p>Health Canada’s authority to disclose CBI applies to regulatory information related to therapeutic products, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, vaccines, blood and blood products, donor semen for assisted conception, gene and cell therapies, tissues and organs, and medical devices. It does not apply to natural health products. </p><p>

Health Canada will disclose only information required for a specific project relating to the protection or promotion of human health or public safety. Requestors must describe the research project or other activity for which they are seeking access to CBI, and justify how it relates to the purpose of disclosure, i.e. the protection or promotion of human health or public safety. Requestors should also demonstrate that the requested information is not available from other sources.</p><p>

Health Canada will not disclose information to individuals or organizations with interests that could derive commercial benefit from the information.  </p>

<a id="C1"><h3>How to request access to confidential business information?</h3></a>
<p>Complete the request form, including a description of the project and providing proof of relevant qualifications for individuals who will have access to the CBI.  Requests should be submitted to the address provided on the request form.</p>

<a id="D1"><h3>How does Health Canada decide whether or not to disclose confidential business information?</h3></a>
<p>Health Canada’s decision is based on rigorous scientific evaluation and a process that ensures fair and consistent review of requests.  Key steps on the process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Screening:  Requests are reviewed to ensure that they are complete, including proof of qualifications, and a project description that includes a specific purpose for seeking access to CBI. Incomplete requests may be provided an opportunity to provide missing information.</li>
<li>Assessment: Complete requests are referred to a Review Committee, chaired by the Senior Medical Advisor and with relevant scientific and clinical expertise, for assessment. The Committee will assess the requestor’s qualifications to determine whether they carry out functions relating to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public. The Committee will also review the proposed project to determine whether it relates to the protection or promotion of human health or the safety of the public, and whether it would add to the body of knowledge in the area. If the request does not meet these requirements, it will be denied at this stage.</li>
<li>Record search:  For a request that meets the requirements of the assessment, Health Canada will conduct a search of its records. If the records contain no CBI, the requestor will be notified and provided an opportunity to obtain the information from the appropriate Health Canada office. </li>
<li>Consultation with requestor. If CBI is included in records relating to an assessed request, the requestor will be notified and, where large volumes of records have been identified, may be consulted to refine their request. At this stage the requestor will be asked to complete a Conflict of Interest Declaration and to sign a Confidentiality Agreement. Further information may also be required in order to complete Health Canada’s review of the request.</li>
<li>Recommendation:  Once the requestor has provided a completed Conflict of Interest Declaration, signed Confidentiality Agreement and any other required information, the Review Committee will prepare a recommendation on what records, if any, should be disclosed by Health Canada. Only records that are directly related to the purpose of the project will be recommended for disclosure.</li>
<li>Decision:  The Review Committee recommendation is considered by a Health Canada official designated to exercise the Minister’s authority to disclose CBI under the Food and Drugs Act (section 21.1(3)(c)). This role is performed by a senior official with authority for regulatory decisions, who has not participated in the deliberations of the Review Committee. </li>
<li>Notification to requestor.  Health Canada will notify the requestor of its decision. When the decision is to disclose CBI, arrangements will be made to ensure secure transmission of the information and to confirm that safeguards are in place to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information. </li>
</ol>

<a id="E1"><h3>How does Health Canada safeguard the confidentiality of disclosed information?</h3></a>
<p>Before disclosing the information, Health Canada requires requestors to sign a Confidentiality Agreement with stringent requirements to maintain the confidentiality of disclosed information. Among other things, the disclosed information can be used only for the purposes of the approved project and with appropriate safeguards. The Confidentiality Agreement also prohibits reproduction of disclosed information and requires that it be destroyed following completion of the project. </p><p>
Health Canada closely monitors compliance with the terms of its Confidentiality Agreements and has recourse to legal action in the event of a breach of contract.</p>
