        <p>On September 19, 2013, Health Canada issued a Notice of Compliance for the drug product Abilify.</p>
        <p>The market authorization was based on quality (chemistry and manufacturing), non-clinical (pharmacology and toxicology), and clinical (pharmacology, safety, and efficacy) information submitted. Based on Health Canada's <a href="#a7">review</a>, the <a href="#a2">benefit/risk</a> profile of Abilify was considered favorable for the management of inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) [World Health Organization (WHO) Group 4] and persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment in adult patients (&ge;18 years of age) with WHO Functional Class II or III pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<details class="mrgn-bttm-md">
<summary><strong>1.	What was approved?</strong></summary>
        <p>Abilify, a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, was authorized for the management of inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [CTEPH, World Health Organization (WHO) Group 4], or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, in adult patients (&ge;18 years of age) with WHO Functional Class II or III pulmonary hypertension.</p>
        <p>Abilify is contraindicated for use concomitantly with other drugs affecting the nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) pathway, due to the risk of developing potentially life-threatening episodes of hypotension or syncope. These drugs include phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors [for example (e.g.,) sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil], nitrates taken either regularly or intermittently, in any form (e.g. oral, sublingual, transdermal, inhalation), and nitric oxide donors, such as amyl nitrate. Abilify is also contraindicated during pregnancy and nursing and in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Abilify or to any ingredient in the formulation. Abilify was approved for use under the conditions stated in the Abilify Product Monograph taking into consideration the potential risks associated with the administration of this drug product.</p>
        <p>Abilify (0.5&nbsp;<abbr title="milligrams">mg</abbr>, 1.0&nbsp;mg, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg riociguat) is presented as a film-coated tablet. In addition to the medicinal ingredient, the film-coated tablet contains cellulose microcrystalline, crospovidone, hypromellose 5cP, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, sodium laurilsulfate. The film-coating is composed of hydroxypropylcellulose, hypromellose 3cP, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide. The Abilify 1.0&nbsp;mg, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg tablet film coating contain in addition ferric oxide yellow and the Abilify 2.0&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg tablet film coating contain in addition ferric oxide red.</p>

<summary><strong>2.	Why was Abilify approved?</strong></summary>	
        <p>Health Canada considers that the benefit/risk profile of Abilify is favourable for the management of inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [CTEPH, World Health Organization (WHO) Group 4], or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, in adult patients (&ge;18 years of age) with WHO Functional Class II or III pulmonary hypertension.</p>
        <p>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), one of the leading causes of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right heart failure, is primarily caused by venous thromboembolism (VTE), and as such is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although CTEPH can present at any age, more than half the adults are diagnosed during their peak productive years (ages 18-45 years). The treatment of choice is a surgical treatment by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), a procedure to physically remove pulmonary arterial thrombi. However, a substantial proportion of patients are not suitable for surgery. These patients, plus patients who present with persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after PEA (approximately 30% of patients after PEA) are in need of disease modifying therapies. There are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for CTEPH.</p>
        <p>Abilify has been shown to be efficacious for the management of inoperable CTEPH (WHO Group&nbsp;4) or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment in adult patients (&ge;18 years of age) with WHO Functional Class II or III pulmonary hypertension.</p>
        <p>The market authorization was based on data from one Phase III pivotal study (CHEST-1), one supportive Phase III study (PATENT-1) and their respective on-going-extension studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2).</p>
        <p>The CHEST-1 study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multi-national study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Abilify [1.0&nbsp;<abbr title="milligram">mg</abbr>, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg three times daily (TID)] in 261 patients with CTEPH. These patients were considered not to be eligible for PEA, or had recurrent CTEPH after an unsuccessful PEA. Data from CHEST-1 showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy variable - the standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The Abilify-treated patients improved their walking distance in the 6MWT of 39&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;79&nbsp;<abbr title="meters">m</abbr> [standard deviation (SD)] at Week&nbsp;16 compared to a deterioration of -6&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;84&nbsp;m in patients treated with placebo. Statistically significant improvements (p&lt;0.001) in relevant secondary hemodynamic parameters [cardiac output (CO), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)] were also noted. Also, relatively more patients on Abilify ended the study in a lower WHO functional class than patients on placebo.</p>
        <p>Supportive evidence regarding efficacy came from study PATENT-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase&nbsp;III study in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In PATENT-1, a total of 254&nbsp;patients administered Abilify significantly improved their walking distance in the 6MWT compared to 127&nbsp;patients on placebo.</p>
        <p>Long-term maintenance of efficacy of Abilify was confirmed by two ongoing long-term studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2). At 18&nbsp;months, the improvements in the 6MWT, pulmonary hemodynamic variables and clinical scales seen at Weeks&nbsp;12 and 16 of the short-term controlled studies (PATENT-1 and CHEST-1) are maintained.</p>
        <p>The safety evaluation for Abilify was conducted in more than 650&nbsp;patients in Phase&nbsp;III clinical studies. The identified safety concerns include hypotension and its sequelae [that is (i.e.,) dizziness, loss of consciousness, or syncope], gastrointestinal disorders (i.e., dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), risk of bleeding and the over-additive blood pressure-lowering effects during co-administration with other drugs affecting the nitric oxide-soluble guanylatecyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) pathway, such as phosphodiesterase type&nbsp;5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These issues have been addressed through appropriate labelling in the Abilify Product Monograph.</p>
        <p>The most common adverse events (AEs) occurring in &ge;10% of patients treated with Abilify [up to 2.5&nbsp;mg TID] were headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, peripheral edema, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Frequencies of AEs were comparable between the CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 studies, with the exception of a lower rate of anemia in the CTEPH patients and a higher rate of dizziness.</p>
        <p>There were 11&nbsp;deaths in the pooled controlled studies; 5 in the Abilify groups and 6 in the placebo groups. In both groups, most fatal events were due to progression of the disease.</p>
        <p>A Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Abilify was submitted by Bayer Inc. to Health Canada. Upon review, the RMP was considered to be acceptable. The RMP is designed to describe known and potential safety issues, to present the monitoring scheme and when needed, to describe measures that will be put in place to minimize risks associated with the product.</p>
        <p>Overall, the therapeutic benefits seen in the pivotal study, the supportive study and the two extension studies are favourable and the benefits of therapy with Abilify are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Abilify has an acceptable safety profile based on the non-clinical data and clinical studies. The identified safety issues can be managed through labelling and adequate patient monitoring. Appropriate warnings and precautions are included in the Abilify Product Monograph to address the identified safety concerns.</p>
        <p>This New Drug Submission complies with the requirements of sections C.08.002 and C.08.005.1 and therefore Health Canada has granted the Notice of Compliance pursuant to section C.08.004 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/index.html" title="Food and Drug Regulations (external link)"><em>Food and Drug Regulations</em></a>.

<summary><strong>7.	What was the scientific rationale for Health Canada's decision?</strong></summary>		
        <h4 id="clinical">Clinical Basis for Decision</h4>
        <h5>Clinical Pharmacology</h5>
        <p>Abilify (riociguat) is a highly specific stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO). When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme enhances synthesis of the signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which plays an important role in regulating vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation.</p>
        <p>Abilify has a dual mode of action: it sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. It also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO. Abilify, as a stimulator of sGC, addresses NO deficiency by restoring the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, leading to increased generation of cGMP. There is a direct relationship between the concentration of Abilify in the plasma and hemodynamic parameters, such as systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure, and cardiac output.</p>
        <p>The comprehensive clinical pharmacology program included studies in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and in hepatically impaired, renally impaired and healthy subjects.</p>
        <p>A total of four safety concerns have been identified with the use of Abilify, namely, hypotension, co-administration with other drugs affecting the nitric oxide-soluble guanylatecyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-sGC-cGMP) pathway, gastro-intestinal disorders and risk of bleeding. As a sGC stimulator, Abilify acts as a vasodilatator, lowering the pulmonary and systemic blood pressures which can cause hypotension. Concomitant use of Abilify with nitrates or phosphodiesterase type&nbsp;5 (PDE5) inhibitors can also cause hypotension by having a synergistic effect on the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Abilify has smooth muscle relaxation properties not only in the arterial wall but also in the gastrointestinal system, which can cause gastrointestinal disorders, such as dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Finally, the risk of bleeding with the use of Abilify was a very common adverse event (AE), particularly in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Idiopathic bleeding events were observed in 58 (11.8%) of the Abilify treated patients compared to 18 (8.4%) in the placebo group. There were 101&nbsp;adverse bleeding events in the two controlled trials (CHEST-1 and PATENT-1), 12 of which were serious events (all in the Abilify group). Appropriate warnings and precautions are included in the approved Abilify Product Monograph.</p>
        <p>Overall, the clinical pharmacological data support the use of Abilify for the specified indication. Appropriate warnings and precautions are in place in the approved Abilify Product Monograph to address the identified safety concerns.</p>
        <p>For further details, please refer to the Abilify Product Monograph, approved by Health Canada and available through the <a href="http://webprod5.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/index-eng.jsp">Drug Product Database</a>.</p>
        <h5 id="clinical_efficacy">Clinical Efficacy</h5>
        <p>The clinical efficacy of Abilify was evaluated in one pivotal Phase III study (CHEST-1) and one supportive study (PATENT-1).</p>
        <p>The pivotal Phase III study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multi-national study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Abilify [1.0&nbsp;<abbr title="milligram">mg</abbr>, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg, or 2.5&nbsp;mg three times daily (TID)] in 261&nbsp;patients aged from 19&nbsp;to&nbsp;80&nbsp;years old, who were considered not eligible for pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) (72%), or who had recurrent chronic thromboembolism pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (28%) after an unsuccessful PEA. The majority of patients had a World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class II (31%) or III (64%) CTEPH at baseline and were mostly Caucasians (71%), female (66%), and middle-aged [59&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;14&nbsp;standard deviation (SD) years]. The mean baseline 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) for these patients was 347&nbsp;<abbr title="meters">m</abbr>.</p>
        <p>In total, 173&nbsp;patients received Abilify and 88&nbsp;patients received placebo for 16 weeks. During the first 8&nbsp;weeks, patients were uptitrated to the highest tolerable dose. The dose of Abilify was titrated every two weeks based on the patient's systolic blood pressure and signs or symptoms of hypotension. The 8-week titration phase was followed by an 8-week main study phase.</p>
        <p>The primary efficacy endpoint was a measure of exercise tolerance, described as the distance covered in a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) performed after 16&nbsp;weeks in accordance with the American Thoracic Society guideline. This test reflects an individual's ability to perform daily physical activities The secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after 16&nbsp;weeks, change from baseline in N-terminal&nbsp;prohormone&nbsp;B-type&nbsp;natriuretic&nbsp;peptide (NT-proBNP) after 16&nbsp;weeks [(NT-proBNP is a neurohormone release by the heart and thought to be a reliable indicator for cardiac failure)], change from baseline in WHO functional class after 16 weeks, time to clinical worsening (TTCW), change from baseline in Borg CR 10 Scale or Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale (measured at the end of the 6MWT) after 16&nbsp;weeks, change from baseline in European-quality of life 5-dimensions instrument (EQ-5D) questionnaire after 16&nbsp;weeks and change from baseline in &quot;Living with Pulmonary Hypertension (LPH)&quot; questionnaire after 16&nbsp;weeks.</p>
        <p>Results at the 6MWT, which measures the distance a patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes, showed improvements from week&nbsp;2 onward. At week&nbsp;16, the mean increase in the 6MWD within the Abilify group was 46&nbsp;m (least-squares) [95%&nbsp;Confidence Interval&nbsp;(CI): 25&nbsp;m to 67&nbsp;m; p&lt;0.0001] compared to placebo. Improvements of Abilify over placebo were observed in all sub-groups evaluated, such as the inoperable patients [number of patients (n)&nbsp;=&nbsp;189], who demonstrated an increase in 6MWD of 54&nbsp;m (95%&nbsp;CI: 29&nbsp;m to 79&nbsp;m), and patients with recurrent or persisting CTEPH following PEA (n = 72), who demonstrated an increase in 6MWD of 27&nbsp;m (95%&nbsp;CI: -10&nbsp;m to 63&nbsp;m). In patients with a WHO functional class of III/IV at baseline, Abilify led to a 53&nbsp;m (95% CI: 27&nbsp;m to 79&nbsp;m) improvement in the 6MWD from baseline to week&nbsp;16. In patients with a WHO functional class of I/II at baseline, the treatment effect was 26&nbsp;m (95% CI: -9&nbsp;m to 59&nbsp;m). A larger proportion of patients in the Abilify group (1.0 to 2.5&nbsp;mg) had an improvement in 6MWD of at least 30&nbsp;m by week&nbsp;16 compared to the placebo group: [63% versus (vs.) 30%].</p>
        <p>Improvements across all the secondary efficacy endpoints were observed in the Abilify treatment group. A reduction of PVR against placebo of 246&nbsp;<abbr title="dynes second per centimeter to the power of five">dyn&middot;sec/cm<sup>5</sup></abbr>(95%&nbsp;CI:&nbsp;-303&nbsp;to -190, p&lt;0.0001) was observed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The baseline for PVR was 791&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;432&nbsp;dyn&middot;sec/cm5 in the Abilify group and 779&nbsp;&plusmn; 401&nbsp;dyn&middot;sec/cm5 in the placebo group. Levels of NT-proBNP were significantly reduced in the Abilify group; placebo-corrected mean change from baseline was -444&nbsp;<abbr title="pictogram per millilitre">pg/mL</abbr> (95%&nbsp;CI&nbsp;-843 to&nbsp;-45, p&lt;0.0001). A total of 32.9% of patients in the individual dose titration group (riociguat 1.0 to 2.5&nbsp;mg) compared to 14.9% patients in the placebo group had an improvement of at least one WHO functional class (p = 0.0026). The secondary endpoint of Time To Clinical Worsening (TTCW) was a combined endpoint of death (all-cause mortality) and events reflective of residual clinical worsening. The sum of events leading to clinical worsening had a lower event rate in the Abilify group (2.3%) than in the placebo group (5.7%), but the difference was not considered statistically significant (p = 0.1724). Benefit was observed in both inoperable and operable CTEPH patients. Baseline values for the Borg CR 10 Scale were comparable in both treatment groups. Between baseline and week&nbsp;16, the mean Borg CR&nbsp;10 Scale decreased in the Abilify group (mean change of -0.83), but remained almost unchanged in the placebo group (mean change of 0.17). The treatment difference between the Abilify group and the placebo group was statistically significant (p = 0.0035). However, since the Borg Scale was below clinical worsening in the hierarchical testing order for secondary variables, statistical significance cannot be formally claimed for this variable. Also for EQ-5D, although statistical significance in the improvement of an individual's perceived quality of life cannot be formally claimed, the self-reported score improved for the Abilify group while it worsened for the placebo group (+0.0615 &plusmn; 0.2768 vs. -0.0819 &plusmn; 0.3446 placebo; p&lt;0.0001). The last secondary variable, the LPH questionnaire, is a self-report measuring the effects of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and PH-specific treatments on an individual's quality of life. The results showed that, at the last visit, patients in the Abilify group had a statistically nonsignificant improvement in perceived quality of life compared to patients in the placebo group (-6.72&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;18.62. vs. -2.09&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;19.31 placebo; p = 0.1220).</p>
        <strong>Supportive Studies</strong>
        <p>Supportive evidence regarding efficacy comes from a Phase&nbsp;III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational study (PATENT-1) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Abilify in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A total of 586&nbsp;patients were enrolled in the 12&nbsp;week study. Of the 586&nbsp;patients enrolled, 445 were randomized and 443 received study medication (254 in the Abilify individual titration (IDT) group, 126 in the placebo group and 63 in the Abilify 1.0-1.5&nbsp;mg group).</p>
        <p>In PATENT-1, the patients on Abilify significantly improved their walking distance in the 6MWT from baseline to week&nbsp;12 compared to the patients on placebo. The estimated, placebo-corrected overall treatment effect was 35.78&nbsp;m (95%&nbsp;CI: 20.06&nbsp;m to 51.51&nbsp;m; p&lt;0.0001). Pulmonary hemodynamic and clinically important secondary endpoint variables (CO, PVR, Borg dyspnea scale and change in WHO functional class) also pointed at statistically significant improvements of patients on Abilify.</p>
        <p>The long-term maintenance of efficacy was confirmed by 2 ongoing long-term studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2). At 18&nbsp;months, the improvements in the 6MWD, pulmonary hemodynamic variables and clinical scales seen at Weeks&nbsp;12 and 16 of the short-term controlled studies were maintained (data cut-off April/May 2012).</p>
        <p>For more information, refer to the Abilify Product Monograph, approved by Health Canada and available through the <a href="http://webprod5.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/index-eng.jsp">Drug Product Database</a>.</p>
        <h5>Clinical Safety</h5>
        <p>The clinical safety evaluation was based primarily on data from one pivotal study (CHEST-1) and one supportive study (PATENT-1) previously described in the <a href="#clinical_efficacy"><em>Clinical Efficacy</em></a> section. The safety of Abilify was also assessed in two long term open-label extension studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2).</p>
        <p>CHEST-2 was a long-term extension, multicentre, multinational study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Abilify (1.0&nbsp;mg, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg or 2.5&nbsp;mg TID) in patients with CTEPH (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;237 patients from CHEST-1). The mean treatment duration at the cut-off date was 388 days with a median duration of 336&nbsp;days (range 15 to 989&nbsp;days) and a total treatment exposure of 206&nbsp;person years. PATENT-2 was a long-term extension, multi-centre, multi-national study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Abilify (1.0&nbsp;mg, 1.5&nbsp;mg, 2.0&nbsp;mg or 2.5&nbsp;mg TID) in patients with symptomatic PAH (n = 396&nbsp;patients from PATENT-1).</p>
        <p>The safety analyses included evaluation of adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and deaths. In the pooled controlled studies (CHEST-1 and PATENT-1), 490&nbsp;patients were exposed to Abilify and 214 to placebo. In the pooled extension studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2), 557&nbsp;patients were treated with Abilify.</p>
        <p>Considering Abilify is a vasodilator, common AEs observed in the Phase III clinical studies were dizziness (19.8% of patients in the Abilify group compared to 13.1% in the placebo group), (pre)syncope and hypotension (10% of patients in the Abilify group compared to 3.7% in the placebo group). Bleeding was also a very common AE. Idiopathic bleeding events were observed in 58 (11.8%) of the Abilify-treated patients compared to 18 (8.4%) in the placebo group. Of the 58&nbsp;cases, 10&nbsp;cases were considered serious adverse events (SAE) and 1&nbsp;case was fatal. Pulmonary hemorrhage was reported in less than 1% of patients treated during long-term extension studies with Abilify. Anemia also occurred commonly in the pooled Phase III studies. Anemia (or respective changes in laboratory values reported as an AE) was noted in 33 (6.7%) of the Abilify-treated patients, in 2 of these cases as an SAE. Anemia occurred in 5 (2.3%) of the patients on placebo, once as an SAE.</p>
        <p>The overall rates of discontinuation due to an AE in the pooled Phase III studies (CHEST&nbsp;1 and PATENT&nbsp;1) were 2.9% for Abilify and 5.1% for placebo.</p>
        <p>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any AE occurring after the first dose administration until 48&nbsp;hours after the last dose administration. The most frequent TEAEs (&gt; 10%) in each treatment group of CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 studies were headache (26.9%), dizziness (19.8%), dyspepsia (18.6%), peripheral edema (17.3%), nausea (14.1%), diarrhea (12.0%), bleeding (11.8%), and vomiting (10.2%).</p>
        <p>There were 11 deaths in the pooled controlled studies (CHEST-1 and PATENT-1); 5 in the Abilify groups and 6 in the placebo groups. In both groups, most fatal events were due to progression of the disease. Sepsis occurred in one fatal case, and death from hemorrhage or hemoptysis occurred in 2&nbsp;patients on Abilify. There were 23&nbsp;deaths in the pooled extension studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2). Most fatalities (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;15) were due to progression of the disease: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiac arrest, right ventricular failure, cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock. Hemorrhage was the cause of 3&nbsp;deaths. Other causes of death were: sudden cardiac death, sepsis, shock, and lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Frequencies of adverse events were comparable between the CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 studies, with the exception of a lower rate of anemia in the CTEPH patients and a higher rate of dizziness.</p>
        <p>Overall, Abilify is well-tolerated. The submitted data support the safety of Abilify for use in patients with CTEPH who are not considered candidates for surgical treatment, or who have persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension post-operatively. There were no signs of cardiac, renal or hepatic toxicity. The risk of hypotension is minimized by a gradual individual dose titration to the highest tolerated dose, and by contraindicating concomitant use with other drugs affecting the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Gastrointestinal disorders occurred very commonly, but seemed to be manageable, as few subjects discontinued from the clinical studies. The apparent increased risk of bleeding has been addressed in the label by means of a prominent warning and a description of bleeding events in the adverse reactions section of the Product Monograph. The risk of pulmonary bleeding and hemoptysis may be avoided by contraindicating its use in patients with a history of hemoptysis. As stated in the Product Monograph, patients with a history of serious hemoptysis should avoid the use of Abilify. For more information, refer to the Abilify Product Monograph, approved by Health Canada and available through the <a href="http://webprod5.hc-sc.gc.ca/dpd-bdpp/index-eng.jsp">Drug Product Database</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="non_clinical">Non-Clinical Basis for Decision</h4>
        <p>The non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies support the use of riociguat (the medicinal ingredient in Abilify) for the management of inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) [World Health Organization (WHO) Group 4], or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment, in adult patients (&ge;18 years of age) with WHO Functional Class II or III pulmonary hypertension.</p>
        <p>In order to support the human use of Abilify, which acts as a stimulator of soluble guanylatecyclase (sGC), a comprehensive set of non-clinical studies were conducted in <em>in vitro</em> assays and <em>in vivo </em>with various animal models. As such, the potential toxicity of riociguat was comprehensively evaluated in a program of: oral and intravenous single-dose studies in rodents, and oral repeat-dose general toxicity studies in rodents (up to 13&nbsp;weeks in mice; up to 26&nbsp;weeks in rats) and dogs (up to 52&nbsp;weeks); <em>in vitro </em>and<em> in vivo </em>genotoxicity studies; 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats; and reproductive and developmental studies. The majority of the findings in oral repeat-dose studies were attributed to effects related to the pharmacological properties of riociguat, notably reduced gastrointestinal tract motility due to smooth muscle relaxation, as well as reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate secondary to vasodilation.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular pathological findings such as endocarditis, perivascular edema and tunica media hypertrophy of coronary vessels related to treatment with Abilify were observed in 13-and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, without clear overall correlation between the morphological lesions and hemodynamic changes on an individual animal basis. Pathological changes in bone and/or growth plates were observed in young rats, but not in mature rats and dogs. Riociguat was not genotoxic in a battery of <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> tests and was not carcinogenic in rats at exposures up to 2&nbsp;times the maximum recommended human dose. Abilify is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant due to significant maternal and fetal toxicity observed in rats and rabbits. The main metabolite of riociguat, M1, demonstrated a comparable but less potent pharmacological profile and a similar general toxicology profile as riociguat. Overall, the non-clinical pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology and toxicology support the clinical use of Abilify.</p>
        <p>The results of the non-clinical studies as well as the potential risks to humans have been included in the Abilify Product Monograph. In view of the intended use of Abilify, there are no pharmacological/toxicological issues within this submission which preclude authorization of the product.</p>
